All one reads is more one's than other's who wrote.
Meaning one evinces of others wrote is not there.

In the specific case this develops into:

Anything you read is more yours than mine I wrote.

If other wrote what I write here and they care then be they happy with the credit as I live of air and food, not of credit.

If you want to get the credit of what I write here be my guest because anything other read is more theirs than one's who wrote, ever.

If you want to hold me accountable for anything mine you read then desist as nothing you read that I wrote contains any of the meaining you may evince of it.

Signed,
you who read
